### Problem Statement

For a hypotehtical Indian startup named 'Foodie' lets build a conversational bot (chatbot) which can help users discover restaurants across several Indian cities.
The main purpose of the bot is to help users discover restaurants quickly and efficiently and to provide a good restaurant discovery experience. 
The bot takes the following inputs from the user:
- **City**: Take the input from the customer as a text field. For example:
    - Bot: In which city are you looking for restaurants?
    - User: anywhere in Delhi
- **Cuisine Preference**: Take the cuisine preference from the customer. The bot should list out the following six cuisine categories (Chinese, Mexican, Italian, American, South Indian & North Indian) and the customer can select any one out of that. Following is an example for the same:
    - Bot: What kind of cuisine would you prefer?
    
            Chinese
            Mexican
            Italian
            American
            South Indian
            North Indian
    - User: I’ll prefer Italian!
- **Average budget for two people**: Segment the price range (average budget for two people) into three price categories: lesser than 300, 300 to 700 and more than 700. The bot should ask the user to select one of the three price categories. For example:
    - Bot: What price range are you looking at?

            Lesser than Rs. 300
            Rs. 300 to 700
            More than 700
    - User: in range of 300 to 700
    
- **Email:** The bot should ask the user whether he/she wants the details of the top 10 restaurants on email. If the user replies 'yes', the bot should ask for user’s email id and then send it over email. Else, just reply with a 'goodbye' message. The mail should have the following details for each restaurant:

            Restaurant Name
            Restaurant locality address
            Average budget for two people
            Zomato user rating
            
### Important Notes

- The bot would only work for Tier-1 and Tier-2 cities in India (I have extracted Tier1 and Tier2 cities in India from wikipedia), since for smaller cities, there is not enough restaurant database with us.
- Our chatbot should provide results for tier-1 and tier-2 cities only, while for tier-3 cities, it should reply back with something like _"We do not operate in that area yet"_.
- Our bot would be able to identify common synonyms of city names, such as Bangalore/Bengaluru, Mumbai/Bombay etc.
- While showing the results to the user, the bot would display the top 5 restaurants in a sorted order (descending) of the average Zomato user rating (on a scale of 1-5, 5 being the highest). The format would be: {restaurant_name} in {restaurant_address} has been rated {rating}.
